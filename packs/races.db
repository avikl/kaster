Like the rock gnomes, many halflings live among Big Folk in the human lands. They are resourceful and quick, perfectly at home among the sprawling human lands or living apart in their own settled communities.</p>\n<p>The halflings' name for their race in Faer&ucirc;n is the <em>hin</em>, although most accept \"halfling\" with a shrug and a smile.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the lightfoot halflings value the experience of travel and the sight of new lands and peoples, the stronghearts are a more organized, oderly, and industrious race. They build to last, and fiercely defend their homelands against threats that their lightfoot kin would simply flee. Northland humans familiar with the easygoing ways of the lightfoot halflings are surprised to learn that some halflings are capable of a warrior tradition and aren't afraid to show a hint of arrogance or confidence in their own abilities and strenghts.

A deep halfling who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a check as though actively searching and can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can.

{"name":"Hadozee","type":"race","img":"systems/D35E/icons/races/half-elf.png","data":{"originVersion":97,"originPack":"","originId":"","possibleUpdate":false,"description":{"value":"<p>A race of simianlike humanoids, hadozee are often referred to as \"winged deck apes.\" It's easy to see where they would come by such a moniker: they are covered in light brown fur, with a slightly stooped posture, a shaggy mane, and a fanged muzzle. And they have flaps of skin that hang beneath their arms that enable gliding, if not true flight. Because they're also good climbers and balancers, hadozee are particularly suited for life aboard a ship sailing the seas of adventure.</p>\n<p>Hadozee stand at about 5&mdash;1/2 to 6 feet tall, though they always seem slightly shorter due to their natural stooped posture. They tend to weigh between 200 and 250 pounds, most of that weight being solid muscle. Their eyes are black and glitter brightly, and their fur can range in color from a light tawny golden brown to a deep chocolate. Hadozee do not really need clothing due to their fur covering, though many who work aboard ships wear harnesses and belts for their tools and weapons. Hadozee generally have about the same lifespan as humans, though they are considered adults a little earlier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most fascinating of all, however, is a hadozee's patagial flaps&mdash;flaps of skin between legs and arms, similar to those of a flying squirrel. With these patagia, the hadozee can launch herself into the air and glide for significant distances. It is not uncommon for hadozee in the rigging of ships not to bother climbing down, but simply throw themselves into the air and glide to another part of the ship.</p>\n<p>Hadozee characters possess the following racial traits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>+2 Dexteriy, -2 Charisma.</li>\n<li>Size Medium.</li>\n<li>A hadozee's base land speed is 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Gliding: Hadozee can use their arm-flaps to glide, negating damage from a fall of any height and allowing them to travel 20 feet horizontally for every 5 feet of descent. A hadozee glides at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability).</li>\n<li>+4 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks: Hadozee are natural climbers and have no fear of narrow pathways. A hadozee does not lose her Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing and can climb unimpeded while holding something in one hand.</li>\n<li>Automatic Languages: Common and Hadozee.
