You can see through the eye no matter where it goes, so you can use it to scout or spy. The eye can&rsquo;t crawl of its own volition, but you can direct it to move or climb up to 20 feet as a move action. Its Climb modifier is equal to your warlock level +8. You can direct a crawling eye in your space to climb back into your eye socket as a move action.</p>\n<p>When you use this invocation, your current and full normal hit point totals are reduced by 2 for as long as the eye is detached. The eye is considered a Fine creature with AC 20 and 2 hit points. Its Hide and Move Silently modifiers are equal to your warlock level.</p>\n<p>For all other purposes, its statistics are equal to yours. You can&rsquo;t cast most invocations or spells through the eye, but any spells or invocations that affect your sense of sight&mdash;such as devil&rsquo;s sight, all-seeing eyes, or detect magic&mdash; function through the eye as though it was still attached.</p>\n<p>If your crawling eye is destroyed, you are dazzled for 1d4 hours, during which time the eye regrows. (If you normally have only one eye, you are blinded instead).

You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level.

If you succeed, all the item&rsquo;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item&rsquo;s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p>\n<p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Area Dispel:&nbsp;</strong>When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature&rsquo;s magic items are not affected.</p>\n<p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p>\n<p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.</p>\n<p>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p>\n<p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.</p>\n<p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Counterspell:</strong>&nbsp;When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell.

For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature&rsquo;s magic items are not affected.</p>\n<p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p>\n<p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.</p>\n<p>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p>\n<p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.</p>\n<p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.</p>\n<p><strong>Counterspell:</strong>&nbsp;When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster&rsquo;s spell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Voracious Feature:</strong>&nbsp;Any creature with an active spell effect dispelled by this invocation takes 1 point of damage per level of the spell effect (no save)</p>","snip":"","spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"showInQuickbar":false,"specialPrepared":false,"isDomainSpell":false,"specialId":null,"changes":[],"combatChanges":[],"requirements":[],"creationChanges":[],"resistances":[],"damageReduction":[],"contextNotes":[],"activateActions":[],"deactivateActions":[],"perRoundActions":[],"container":"None","containerWeightless":false,"identifiedName":"Voracious Dispelling","attack":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"55lf1pXToWgc1Dqy":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.g7Q2vubjAEHmWDHE"}},"_id":"Gq7rEPjaDccZcDhp"}

This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n<p>When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay.
