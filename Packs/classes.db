{"_id":"4fc4V3x1K3WC4v8s","name":"Factotum","type":"class","img":"systems/D35E/icons/spells/named-spells/divine-power.png","data":{"originVersion":0,"originPack":"","originId":"","possibleUpdate":false,"description":{"value":"<p><img style=\"border: none; float: right; shape-outside: polygon(8% 0, 20% 80%, 20% 15%, 0 100%, 0 100%);\" src=\"assassin-emil-kovkorin.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"345\" height=\"526\" /></p>\n<p>It is foolhardy to explore a dungeon alone. Those who attempt to do so quickly find that they lack the skills needed to get the job done. Sometimes, this can happen in larger parties as well. Enter the factotum, a new standard class, capable of mimicking the abilities of others and filling in when the need is greatest.</p>\n<p>After a lifetime of work, few can claim even a fraction of the versatility that the factotum displays every day. Skilled in nearly every art, factotums draw upon their lore to master almost any trade or ability for a brief period of time before other pursuits draw their attention. Whereas bards use their general knowledge to aid others, factotums focus their abilities solely upon themselves. Constantly on the hunt for new abilities and tricks, factotums eventually find the right tool to overcome practically any problem.</p>\n<p>However, a factotum cannot go it alone. He relies on sudden flashes of insight gleaned from his studies and the broad array of his experiences. He might not be the best fighter or the mightiest spellcaster in a group, but when the party needs a stout warrior or an arcane spell, the factotum can provide it.</p>\n<p>If you like having a trick up your sleeve, or if you want to have an answer to almost any problem, then the factotum is the class for you. Your intellect bolsters your fighting ability, and your basic understanding of divine magic and arcane spells allows you to manipulate magical energy.</p>\n<p>You can fill almost any role in the party, but you typically do so only on a temporary basis. If Jozan the cleric suffers a grievous injury, you can provide some healing until he recovers. If mighty Tordek is paralyzed, you can draw your weapon and hold the line for a few rounds. When a troll lurches into view, you can cast an acid spell if Mialee did not prepare one. However, you can pull off such tricks only for a limited time each day. The key to succeeding as a factotum lies in identifying what the group needs at a given moment and filling that need.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>MAKING A FACTOTUM</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a factotum, you are a jack of all trades. For short periods of time, you can stand in for almost any other member of the party. Your intellect, training, and experiences allow you to bolster your efforts in almost any situation. But your magical abilities are at best limited. You can master potent spells, but your lack of formal training makes it difficult for you to use them more than once each day. Furthermore, your understanding of magic is broad rather than deep.</p>\n<p>Intelligence is a factotum's most important ability. Almost everything you do relies upon it. You master so many areas of study because you have the keen mind needed to learn through observation and experience, rather than formal study. When you fight, use a skill, or cast a spell, your Intelligence plays a role in your success. Of course, Dexterity and Strength are useful, too. When you cannot provide a cunning solution to a problem, you can heft an axe or fire a bow as well as a cleric.</p>\n<p>Factotums are commonly humans, halflings, and gnomes. Those races are a natural fit because of their inquisitive nature, personal drive, and clever solutions to tough problems. Longer-lived races, such as dwarves and elves, find a factotum's fickle nature to be a poor imitation of the true mastery that can be attained only through centuries of life. Due to their low Intelligence, half-orcs find the factotum class difficult to master, but some manage to make a name for themselves.</p>\n<p>Factotums can be of any alignment. Some use their abilities for good, helping people in need and learning from the attendant challenges. Other factotums view the world as a well that is rightfully theirs, and they take what they like from it. Relying upon no one but themselves, these evil factotums steal and cheat to gain power and use their abilities to further their own ends. The majority of factotums fall somewhere between these extremes. They appreciate a stable, benevolent society, but they are too absorbed in travel and study to care much about others.</p>\n<p>Factotums usually favor law over chaos; they love to find structure and insight in the topics they study. Chaotic factotums are vagabonds and wanderers who experience life as it comes, believing that whatever topics happen to cross their paths are as good as any other.</p>\n<h2>PLAYING A FACTOTUM</h2>\n<p>Knowledge is everything, and applied knowledge is even better. You adventure out of a sense of curiosity, a desire to pierce the veil of ignorance that shrouds so much of the world. If you hear rumors of an island with beaches of diamonds and mountains of gold, you want to find the island, determine its origin, and learn its secrets. To other adventurers, the entrance to a dungeon is a gateway to treasure and power. To you, it is a promise of secrets waiting in the dungeon's deepest levels.</p>\n<p>Think of yourself as an adventuring scholar, an expert who has the right answer at the right time, a seeker who finds the truths hidden in the world. You are the one who notices that an ogre has a long scar along its leg, allowing you to strike the creature where the old wound has not fully healed. You are the one who read a book on the dark arts, allowing you to conjure the spell needed to banish an ice devil. Other adventurers must prepare their abilities and hope they have the right tools to overcome a challenge. You wait for difficulties to present themselves and then decide what talents to employ.</p>\n<p>Versatility is the key to your success. In some encounters, you draw your weapon and hold back the enemy. In others, you slip around behind the foe to unleash a potent spell. At other times, you scout ahead, uncover traps, and clear the way for your friends.</p>\n<p>Most factotums worship a variety of deities and have holy symbols for every occasion. A typical factotum might offer one prayer to Obad-Hai before venturing into the wilds, and another to Moradin while traveling through an abandoned dwarf mine. Factotums seek a higher understanding of the world than a single deity can offer. Besides, they know enough about divine magic to leach energy from a number of gods. It pays to spread the prayers out.</p>\n<p>If a factotum favors one deity, it is usually Boccob, the god of magic and knowledge. But few factotums are religious fanatics. Instead, they see Boccob as the ideal manifestation of their talents, a cunning mastermind who has accumulated boundless knowledge.</p>\n<p>A few factotums of non-evil alignment revere Vecna. They see that dread deity as the keeper of knowledge and secrets, and they hope to uncover his most potent mysteries to better master the world. While they might revile Vecna's methods, they respect the knowledge he keeps and the secrecy with which he protects it.</p>\n<p>You work well with other classes whose role is clearly defined, such as fighters, barbarians, clerics, sorcerers, and wizards. While you appreciate the dual roles of paladins, druids, bards, and rangers, you often feel frustration at their difficulty in identifying where their skills are needed most. You have the most in common with rogues and wizards, whose reliance on cunning and knowledge is similar to your own.</p>\n<p>You are best suited to filling whatever role the party needs, so try not to spend your inspiration points too early in a battle. If the fighter falls to a lucky attack, you will have to take his place and hold back the enemy. If the wizard runs out of spells, your arcane talents will prove crucial. Likewise, save your healing for a critical juncture or until the cleric is down or out of spells.</p>\n<p>You have unmatched flexibility in building your talents. You can emphasize one ability or nurse a broad range of abilities. In most cases, feats that consistently improve your talents are better than feats that function only in certain situations. For example, Weapon Focus improves all your attacks, whereas Power Attack provides more limited benefits.</p>\n<p>When multiclassing or taking levels in a prestige class, find combinations that broaden your abilities or that increase your flexibility. Bonus feats allow you to improve your combat prowess while retaining much of your flexibility. If your feats make you a more competent warrior, you can spend inspiration points on spells rather than on improving your attack rolls and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>The chameleon prestige class (Races of Destiny) deserves special mention. This class allows you to change your focus on a daily basis, making it possible to switch from being a skilled warrior to being a potent spellcaster. This prestige class is a great combination with the factotum class. The chameleon's focus allows you to fill a single role well, and the factotum's inspiration points let you retain the flexibility to heal an ally, make a sneak attack, or deliver a decisive blow. In many ways, chameleons are factotums who specialize in a few narrow fields.</p>\n<h2>FACTOTUMS IN THE WORLD</h2>\n<p>The factotum class gives players a chance to be the archetypal jack of all trades. Inspiration points allow a factotum to excel in a wide variety of situations because he decides which of his capabilities to bolster. While other classes are locked into certain abilities, a factotum has unmatched flexibility.</p>\n<p>Factotums are curious, driven, and inquisitive. They adventure not only for gold and glory, but also to uncover lost secrets and expand their lore. They find almost any situation interesting, wanting to learn everything from the intricate social protocols of a royal court to the tactics used by rampaging goblins.</p>\n<p>Many factotums become sages and loremasters when they retire. They catalog the lore they uncovered and use it to advise others, particularly adventurers. A retired factotum likely has an archive of maps and charts from his previous exploits, tools that can prove useful for the next generation of explorers.</p>\n<p>Factotums rise to become advisors, sages, and experts in a variety of subjects. Alerach Longseeker, for example, is famous for crossing the Barrier Peaks, the Hellfurnaces, and the Yatil Mountains in a series of solo expeditions. Rumors say that he owns the last surviving map of the location of a fabled dungeon of metal corridors high in the Barrier Peaks.</p>\n<p>Rather than create their own organizations, factotums tend to join groups founded and run by others. Many thieves' guilds employ a few factotums to handle unexpected dangers on a heist. Some factotums join formal adventuring guilds and companies to find ready allies to help them on their expeditions.</p>\n<p>Most commoners have no idea what to make of a factotum's unpredictable skills and abilities. Barbarians, druids, and other folk of the wilderness see factotums as overeducated and overly civilized, but an adventure with one in the wilds quickly dispels that notion. Most adventurers are happy to have a factotum in the party, especially on a dungeon expedition during which traveling back to civilization will be difficult, and determining what dangers lie ahead nearly impossible.</p>\n<h2>FACTOTUM LORE</h2>\n<p>Characters with ranks in Knowledge (local) can research factotums to learn more about them. When a character succeeds on a skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the information from lower DCs.</p>\n<p>DC 15: Factotums are sages and experts who master a variety of talents.</p>\n<p>DC 20: Factotums draw on their training and intelligence to fight well, cast spells, and heal wounds, but they lack the formal training needed to do so consistently.</p>\n<h2>FACTOTUMS IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>Factotums are the closest characters in the D&amp;D game to professional adventurers. Fighters serve as soldiers and mercenaries, wizards delve into the secrets of magic, clerics lead the worship of deities, and rogues beg, borrow, and steal. Factotums, however, explore the world and uncover its secrets. They usually gather in large numbers near well-known dungeons. Many children who dream of gaining wealth and fame by looting tombs, braving the planes, and defeating powerful monsters grow up to become factotums. In rare cases, factotums form professional adventuring unions and guilds, just like blacksmiths, bakers, and other artisans.</p>\n<p>The typical D&amp;D campaign world has plenty of dungeons and treasure to go around. It makes sense that a class of professional adventurers would arise in time. Factotums fill this role - they are the experts who cultivate all the skills needed to make it as adventurers.</p>\n<p>The factotum is readily adaptable to most campaign worlds as a sage, an expert, or a jack of all trades. Fantasy literature offers many examples of a hero who uses his experience and cunning to overcome obstacles. He need not wear heavy armor, carry a sword, or cast a spell to make a name for himself. A quick wit, a brave heart, and boundless energy are enough to best many challenges.</p>\n<p>A factotum is similar to an everyman hero, an average person who uses his wits and bravery. Good examples include wandering adventurers, rugged explorers, and cunning archaeologists. The Indiana Jones movies provide a perfect example of a factotum. Indiana Jones dodges traps, uses his scholarly knowledge to find hidden treasures, handles a whip and a gun, and throws a mean left hook. In a D&amp;D campaign, replace his gun with a basic understanding of magic, and you have a factotum.</p>\n<p>An encounter with a factotum should highlight his use of a wide range of abilities. A factotum in light armor might appear to be a rogue at first, but he can surprise the party by casting a spell or healing himself. A factotum also makes a useful contact for the PCs. He might share secrets that lead to hidden treasure, sponsor expeditions to recover lost antiquities, and so on.</p>\n<p>EL 6: Alerach Longseeker(NG male half-elf factotum 6) is a retired adventurer who runs a small museum filled with strange objects, preserved monsters, and other oddities he acquired during his career. He pays adventuring parties to bring back intriguing trinkets, unusual treasure, and items from ancient civilizations. In return, he provides cash rewards, maps to lost treasures, and other services. Alerach is a mentor to many young factotums, and his personal library is an astounding source of information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:&nbsp;</strong>Any.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die:&nbsp;</strong>d8.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The factotum's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are <em>all</em> skills.

{"_id":"RB8MA6HgtQyRUTEq","name":"Crusader","type":"class","img":"systems/D35E/icons/spells/named-spells/magic-vestment.png","data":{"originVersion":0,"originPack":"","originId":"","possibleUpdate":false,"description":{"value":"<p><img style=\"border: none; float: right; shape-outside: polygon(37% 2%, 16% 20%, 5% 32%, 23% 50%, 19% 67%, 8% 91%, 1% 99%, 99% 100%, 99% 1%);\" src=\"output-onlinepngtools(1).png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"631\" /></p>\n<p>Devoted knight, divine agent, instrument of vengeance, peerless fighting machine - the crusader is a warrior dedicated to good, evil, law, chaos, or some other cause. She seeks out and destroys the enemies of her chosen faith. Strengthened by prayer or absolute devotion to a principle, armored by unshakable faith, and driven by her convictions, a good crusader is a mighty weapon against injustice and malice. An evil crusader, on the other hand, is a cruel and fearsome warrior of darkness.</p>\n<p>A crusader who embraces a religion or holy faith is similar to a paladin in that she commands a number of holy (or unholy) powers. However, a crusader has no skill with divine spellcasting; she is a martial adept whose maneuvers are unpredictable gifts of divine power. Trusting in the power of her chosen deity, she allows faith and intuition to guide her through battle. Many crusaders receive the call to their cause early in life, but never study formally at a temple or monastery. These warriors are gifted with a natural ability to channel the divine energies of their cause, but in a raw, untamed manner. A crusader has absolute faith in her ability to draw on the source of her power, but she never quite knows how that power will manifest.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, a crusader is a competent combatant. She fights as skillfully as a fighter, paladin, or ranger does, relying on heavy armor and a good selection of weapons to gain the edge over her opponents. To this basic fighting prowess, she adds several abilities derived from her absolute faith and devotion to her chosen ideal. When fighting for her cause, a crusader becomes an unstoppable force on the battlefield. Terrible injuries might send less dedicated warriors running from the fight, but a crusader transforms such setbacks into martial fury that enables her to fight on long after other warriors would have been overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>A crusader masters a small number of martial maneuvers as she gains levels. Derived from her extraordinary self-discipline, these maneuvers include catechisms of faith, spiritual devotions, and the ability to strike spectacular blows in the service of her patron or cause. Armed with the power of her faith, she can shatter boulders, shrug off enemy attacks, or rally an army with a single act of bravery.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>MAKING A CRUSADER</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A crusader is primarily a front-line melee battler, much like the fighter or paladin. Her martial maneuvers give her more tactical flexibility than the fighter and make her a dynamic and well-rounded combatant. Most crusaders also make good leaders, since they are both charismatic and dedicated.</p>\n<p>Strength and Constitution are vital to a crusader, since she is often in harm's way. Intelligence is useful for gaining plenty of skill points, which a crusader needs to purchase the ranks in Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Balance, the key skills for her martial disciplines. Dexterity is useful for any character in combat, but a crusader's ability to wear heavy armor means that she is not as dependent on a high Dexterity score as other characters.</p>\n<p>Most crusaders are humans, half-elves, or dwarves, because the ideals of dedication, service, zeal, and courage are important in both dwarf and human cultures. Elves, gnomes, and halflings generally lack the seriousness, single-minded devotion, and moderate fanaticism required to succeed as crusaders. Half-orcs rarely become crusaders, but those who do follow this path often excel at it. Many half-orcs spend their lives searching for an ideal to believe in or a community to which they can belong, and the way of the crusader appeals to such souls.</p>\n<p>A crusader can choose any alignment except neutral - she must stand for some ideal, whether chaos, good, evil, law, or a combination of principles. To be a crusader is to devote oneself wholeheartedly to a cause or deity, and this way of life leaves no room for indecision or unwillingness to commit. A crusader's alignment reflects her chosen cause, and in some cases molds the maneuvers she can use.</p>\n<p>Good and lawful crusaders are more common than chaotic or evil ones, since obedience and service come more easily to characters of the former alignments. However, the rare evil crusader is a force to be reckoned with. She is a cruel and fearsome reaver - a scourge who preys on the weak and defenseless to honor her dark patrons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING A CRUSADER</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When fog chills the battlefield, and your frost-rimed mail weighs on your stiffening muscles, your faith warms you. It is the fire that burns inside, illuminating your life with the ideals of your patron or cause. Alms or arms for the impoverished, a hand or a lash for the downtrodden, mercy or cruelty - you decide according to your faith. As a living instrument of your cause, you have worked for years to become a weapon worthy of your ideal. Where others hesitate, you press on with certainty, unshakable in your beliefs.</p>\n<p>As a crusader, you undertake adventures according to the dictates of your cause, your temple, or your conscience. You might find yourself in a swampy mausoleum slaying infidel trolls with a sword in one hand and a flask of acid in the other, or bouncing across sahuagin-infested waves on a halfling sloop because you owe a friend safe passage across the straits. You might even find yourself on the cold, muddy field of battle, charging shoulder to shoulder with peasants and soldiers, raising pitchforks and shields against the pelting ice storms of the enemy. The only constant is the depth of your devotion to your cause - the night winds will snuff out the stars before your fidelity ever wavers.</p>\n<p>Your choice of deity is paramount, since religion is an obvious target for the devotion and zeal embodied by this class. If you are good, you might serve Pelor or St. Cuthbert, or perhaps join the beleaguered crusaders of Heironeous, who are famous for their tenacious defense of many a lost cause. Alternatively, if you are a dwarf, Moradin is a natural choice for patron. You might join the Ruby Knights of Wee Jas, who are reputed to be tainted by the necromancy of their Witch Goddess. Chaotic crusaders are rare, but those who worship Kord are often paragons of the Stone Dragon discipline, and Ehlonna's ambushing crusaders tend to be adept at taking and holding forestland. If you are evil, you might take up the cause of Nerull or Erythnul the Many, whose crusaders are plagues upon the land.</p>\n<p>Your power stems from your devotion to your cause, and you value martial prowess, dedication, and self-discipline. You generally get along well with paladins, clerics, fighters, and warblades, as long as their alignments are compatible with yours. You might scorn those of antithetical alignments as heathens or target them with your proselytizing, depending on the evangelism inherent in your own religion. Monks and swordsages are also worthy companions for you, although their reliance on ki and skill, rather than faith and armor, is suspect. The subterfuge of rogues, the superficiality of bards, and the susceptibility of most arcane casters to a single greataxe blow force members of those classes to prove themselves before earning your esteem.</p>\n<p>Your specific tactics in battle depend on the discipline you chose and the maneuvers you have learned. However, certain tactics are common to all crusaders.</p>\n<p>As a zealous proponent of your cause, you are generally at the forefront of any battle. Fighting on the front line allows you to maximize the benefits you gain from your class abilities, and also to protect a weaker ally by absorbing an enemy's blows yourself. Doing so benefits both you and your party in various ways. First, your steely resolve ability makes any attacks you deliver after taking damage both more accurate and more powerful than they were before you were injured. Furthermore, if opponents focus on you, they cannot injure your allies. Thus, taking damage each round should be your goal. The sooner you can engage the toughest opponent in melee, the faster you can bolster your attacks. As a crusader, you're at your best when you can take on the monster or opponent that deals the most damage.</p>\n<p>Other tactics vary according to your chosen discipline. Stone Dragon crusaders favor head-on charges, boulderrolling into opponents and mountain-hammering anyone left standing. If you have a high Strength score, you should consider feats that take advantage of that ability if you choose this path (such as Power Attack, Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Overrun, and Improved Sunder). As a Devoted Spirit crusader, some of your maneuvers function only against creatures with opposed alignments. Devoted Spirit crusaders are often hunters on the battlefield, dedicated to chasing down the most dangerous foes. If you are a White Raven crusader, you are more group-oriented than other crusaders. Fighting shoulder to shoulder with allies, directing flanks, coordinating charges, and covering a cleric while he heals the wounded are among the specialties of a White Raven crusader.</p>\n<p>At high levels, your mettle ability affords you an extra measure of confidence when you confront enemies that use spells or spell-like abilities. Many demons, devils, and other outsiders have spell-like abilities, and these are precisely the foes that you are trained to vanquish (particularly if you're a Devoted Spirit crusader). Combined with the indomitable soul ability, mettle can prove to be surpassingly powerful.</p>\n<p>Ever since the Spirit Seeker was torn apart by demons during the catastrophic battle that ended in the destruction and dispersal of the Shadow Tiger horde, master crusaders have sought to attain his perfect harmony of spirit, body, and weapon mastery. In three warring stone citadels, the combat masters of the Vix Tholm, the Ruby Knights of Wee Jas, and the reth dekala each teach pilgrims the three precepts of combat: skill, self-discipline, and knowledge.</p>\n<p>To take training at a citadel, you must maintain maximum ranks in your most important skills. Rare is a crusader who does not have maximum ranks in the skill most appropriate to her path (Balance for Stone Dragon, Intimidate for Devoted Spirit, and Diplomacy for White Raven). In addition, you live and die by your discipline. If you hope to achieve true mastery, you must choose your discipline wisely and devote yourself to it completely. If you're physically weak, you would be ill-advised to pursue the path of the Stone Dragon, but your strength of will might serve you well on the path of the Devoted Spirit.</p>\n<p>If you're advancing as a Stone Dragon adept, you seek to acquire items, learn feats, and develop maneuver combinations that emphasize strength and direct confrontation. If yours is the path of the White Raven, you focus on your leadership abilities and the tactical details of combat. If you embrace the Devoted Spirit discipline, you turn inward, cultivating wisdom and devout faith.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>CRUSADERS IN THE WORLD</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Crusaders bring clashing steel, stirring speeches, and intense fervor to the campaign. The first sign of a crusader's presence might be a knight-herald riding alone down the Processional to the King's Fane, where he tacks a scroll to the door and promptly gallops off, his helmeted visage revealing nothing.</p>\n<p>Crusaders can launch grand crusades, each of which can serve as the foundation for a thousand adventures. Crusaders who support less than popular causes might hold clandestine meetings in the night, filled with whispered negotiations. Alternatively, if war has already broken out, the campaign might feature battles along ramparts studded with ballistae and bombarded with flaming pitch. A crusade might be a one-time occurrence when a passing army moves through the kingdom's hinterlands, or it might serve as the entire focus of the campaign, with the PCs moving up through the ranks of a holy army to lead the charge on the infidels' stronghold.</p>\n<p>Crusaders can also move through a campaign world individually. Perhaps a PC crusader is the last adherent of her cause, destined to make a glorious final stand against an evil that has consumed her heritage. She might join with other adventurers, seeking strength in their company. A PC crusader could also be an evangelist from a far land who has come to the campaign area to spread the word of her cause - and perhaps even to recruit adventurers whom she can take back to her homeland to fight alongside her. Perhaps a PC crusader is falsely accused of heresy and forced to travel alone, dodging bounty hunters and assassins, all while upholding her ideals without the support or respect of her erstwhile colleagues.</p>\n<p>A crusader views the world through the twin lenses of faith and battle. A farmer seeding the furrows, a merchant hawking oranges and pottery, an apprentice toasting his fingers with an ironically misfired burning hands - to the crusader, these everyday sights are not random occurrences, but building blocks in the battle between good and evil, law and chaos. For whom does the farmer toil, and to whom does he pay taxes - a good baron, an evil count? Is the merchant trading with priests of Nerull or changing monies with dark emissaries from the reth dekala? If the apprentice learns his spells, to what end will he use them? In every facet of life, the crusader sees some embodiment of her principles.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries since the great battle that resulted in the destruction of the Shadow Tiger horde, many crusaders have sought to emulate the Spirit Seeker. This enigmatic crusader slew the Shadow Master and was subsequently torn apart by demons, but few facts about his life are known. Many, in fact, argue that the Spirit Seeker was a female, and many more argue over the exact faith that this mysterious figure embraced. The Vix Tholm believe that the Seeker was a devotee of Heironeous, but the Chapeaux and Stars of St. Cuthbert claim him as their own. The Ruby Knights of Wee Jas claim that he sought the spirits of the dead and was thus firmly in the Jasite camp.</p>\n<p>After the Temple of Nine Swords collapsed, many crusaders founded martial orders allied with their religions. These new organizations placed the deity before the sword - a reversal of the temple's priorities. The most powerful and secretive of these orders survive today. Many, however, perished as a result of ecclesiastical infighting. The established church hierarchies did not trust these new \"sword orders,\" many of which had recovered enough treasure from the fallen Temple of Nine Swords to make their members very wealthy. Purges and pogroms were common as the churches asserted control over the orders and seized their wealth. The church of St. Cuthbert subsumed its crusader order, but many other churches exterminated their crusaders in the night. The church of Heironeous rose above such petty tyrannies, and it still maintains a cordial relationship with its crusader order, the Vix Tholm, though the relationship is sometimes strained by rivalry. From the start, the Ruby Knights of Wee Jas swore a binding covenant - a dark pact, according to some - to serve the high priests and priestesses as the military arm of the Witch Goddess's temples, and they continue to do so. Crusader orders dedicated to Pelor, Hextor, Ehlonna, and Nerull also exist, and rumors abound of hidden temples that house crusaders who narrowly escaped the purges.</p>\n<p>In a large and openly acknowledged crusader order, promotion is based on battlefield performance. The battlefield, however, is generously defined. It could be a political battlefi eld on which victory consists of the grant of the western valley's taxation rights from the Exchequer. It might also be a specific battlefield, such as the hedge prison of a demon prince in an ancient dungeon, where victory can be attained by thwarting the captive's attempts at escape. The battlefield could even be a spiritual one, where victory is the delivery of pilgrims to a holy site that will inspire them to new heights of religious fervor.</p>\n<p>In a persecuted crusader order, promotion is often based simply on survival. New blood is vital and special, so a crusader who successfully recruits a reliable new member is accorded great honor. Many persecuted orders develop pyramidal hierarchies in which a member's recruits all rank below her in seniority.</p>\n<p>Many lay people cannot tell a crusader from a paladin until the latter calls his horse from the sky or lays hands on the maimed. Like paladins, crusaders of good alignment often become heroes to peasants, laborers, and others to whom gold is a dream and silver an always fleeting reality. Most nobles distrust crusaders because their beliefs take a higher priority in their lives than wealth and status. Paradoxically, most established clerics also distrust crusaders - not only because of faith-based rivalries but also because of the implicit acknowledgment that a crusader order could weaken the influence of nonaffiliated churches in a region's political landscape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>CRUSADER LORE</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Characters with ranks in Knowledge (religion) can research crusaders to learn more about them. When a character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the information from lower DCs.</p>\n<p>DC 10: Crusaders are hot-blooded zealots whose fervor is unrelieved by wisdom.</p>\n<p>DC 15: Crusaders follow the Sublime Way, seeking to perfect their combat skill to better serve their deity. They're not like clerics, and they don't heal the sick or exorcise undead. Crusaders possess very little overt magic, unless you consider what they can do with their swords as magical.</p>\n<p>DC 20: Crusaders can stand up to punishment that no other individual can endure, shrugging off even the most powerful of attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>CRUSADERS IN THE GAME</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Depending on their alignment and disposition, crusaders can appear as allies or enemies, patrons or tyrants. You can use large crusader organizations to offer the PCs work guarding pilgrim caravans, retrieving items from a rival religion's vaults, or representing the organization at court. An evil crusader order might target the PCs' homeland for invasion or persecute all members of their race. The leader of an evil crusader order can make an excellent recurring villain for your campaign - especially if he uses his political clout to pass laws that make life difficult for the PCs. For example, he might institute 2-hour delays at the city gates, forbid foreigners to possess mithral and adamantine, require that all spellbooks be registered and copies stored at the owner's expense, or the like.</p>\n<p>A crusader character expects that his combat prowess will aid the party in its fights and that his religious affiliation will have meaningful consequences in the game world. Accordingly, you should populate your encounters with monsters that oppose your crusader's ideals. Sketching out in advance how a campaign's important NPCs will react to zealot warriors is time well spent.</p>\n<p>One way to adapt crusaders is to remove the religious flavor from the class and replace it with regional or racial elements. In such an arrangement, a crusader would oppose creatures from enemy territory or of a different race. In like manner, her martial maneuvers would represent not catechisms of faith and divine magic, but a battle tradition of slayers handed down over the centuries.</p>\n<p>Crusaders pursue their causes, whatever they might be, with an unmatched zeal. Any time the PCs become involved in an emotionally or politically charged adventure, a crusader might appear. A crusader is especially easy to introduce within the context of a church, as a holy (or unholy) knight dedicated to one distinct and specific aspect of his deity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>EL 8: Miros Xavt(NE male human crusader 4) is a crusader of Erythnul, although he poses as a crusader of Heironeous shepherding a small flock of five human and seven dwarf pilgrims on a journey to the sacred site of Koshtra Amnorn, the highest peak in the Sunspire Mountains, and the inspiration for Reshar's lost epic poem explaining his motivations in unifying the Nine Paths. Miros is in fact leading a group of twelve disguised kenku marauders. They beg the PCs to join them and help escort them to the holy mount. Once out of sight of civilization, they throw off their cloaks and attack while screeching the praises of the God of Slaughter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:&nbsp;</strong>Any except neutral</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die:&nbsp;</strong>d10.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-underline-header);\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The crusader's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge(history) (Int), Knowledge(religion) (Int), Martial Lore (Int), and Ride (Dex).</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Points at 1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;(4 + Int modifier) x4.</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:&nbsp;</strong>4 + Int modifier.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"nameFormula":"","nameFromFormula":false,"tags":[],"uniqueId":"","linkId":"","linkSourceId":"","linkImported":false,"linkSourceName":"","source":"","classSource":"","userNonRemovable":false,"customAttributes":{},"customAttributesLocked":false,"customTag":"","createdBy":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"noInt":false,"noCon":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"multiAttack":false,"multiweaponAttack":false,"uncannyDodge":false,"hasted":false,"firstChangeTargetSelectableOnDescription":false},"conditionFlags":{"dazzled":false,"wildshaped":false,"polymorphed":false},"combatChanges":[],"combatChangesRange":{"maxFormula":"","max":0},"combatChangesAdditionalRanges":{"hasAdditionalRanges":false,"slider1":{"maxFormula":"","max":0,"name":""},"slider2":{"maxFormula":"","max":0,"name":""},"slider3":{"maxFormula":"","max":0,"name":""}},"combatChangesUsesCost":"chargesPerUse","combatChangesApplySpecialActionsOnce":true,"combatChangeCustomDisplayName":"","combatChangeCustomReferenceName":"","sizeOverride":"","counterName":"","resistances":[],"damageReduction":[],"requirements":[],"creationChanges":[],"classType":"base","levels":0,"maxLevel":20,"prestigeLevels":0,"la":0,"crPerHD":4,"hdReplace":"","hdReplaceRacialOnly":false,"addedAbilities":[{"uid":"mwp","level":1},{"uid":"swp","level":1},{"uid":"ap-heavy","level":1},{"uid":"ap-medium","level":1},{"uid":"ap-light","level":1},{"uid":"shp","level":1},{"uid":"tshp","level":1}],"disabledAbilities":[],"turnUndeadLevelFormula":"0","sneakAttackGroup":"none","automaticFeatures":true,"sneakAttackFormula":"0","minionGroup":"none","minionLevelFormula":"0","deckHandSizeFormula":"(@level > 19 ? 7: (@level > 9 ? 6: 5))","knownCardsSizeFormula":"(1/4)*((2*@level)+pow(-1,@level+1)+17)","deckPrestigeClass":true,"spellcastingType":"none","spellcastingSpontaneus":false,"spellsPerLevel":[],"spellsKnownPerLevel":[],"hasSpellbook":false,"hasLimitedSpellbook":false,"spellbook":[],"spellcastingDescription":"<p><strong>Maneuvers:</strong> The disciplines available to you are Devoted Spirit, Stone Dragon, and White Raven.

You ready maneuvers by praying for 5 minutes. The maneuvers you choose remain readied until you decide to pray again and change them. You need not sleep or rest for any long period of time in order to ready your maneuvers; any time you spend 5 minutes in prayer, you can change your readied maneuvers. You begin an encounter with all your readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times you might have already used them since you chose them. When you initiate a maneuver, you expend it for the current encounter, so each of your readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless you recover them, as described below). Crusaders are unique among martial adepts, relying on f lashes of divine inspiration to use their martial maneuvers. As such, you do not control access to your readied maneuvers. Before you take your first action in an encounter, two of your readied maneuvers (randomly determined) are granted to you. The rest of your readied maneuvers are withheld, currently inaccessible. At the end of each turn, one previously withheld maneuver (again, randomly determined) is granted to you, and thus becomes accessible for your next turn and subsequent turns. You can freely choose to initiate any maneuver that is currently granted when your turn begins, but you cannot initiate a withheld maneuver. If you choose not to employ a maneuver in a given round, your currently granted maneuvers remain available, and a previously withheld maneuver is granted, as described above. In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you use your maneuvers or not&mdash;at the end of each of your turns, one withheld maneuver from your selection of readied maneuvers is granted to you. Over the course of a few rounds, all your maneuvers will eventually be granted. If, at the end of your turn, you cannot be granted a maneuver because you have no withheld maneuvers remaining, you recover all expended maneuvers, and a new pair of readied maneuvers is granted to you. Randomly determine which of your maneuvers are granted and which are withheld. At the end of your next turn, a withheld maneuver is granted to you, and the whole process of divine inspiration begins again. You begin an encounter with an additional granted maneuver at 10th level (bringing your total to three), and again at 20th level (bringing your total to four).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stances Known</strong>: You begin play with knowledge of one 1st-level stance from the Devoted Spirit, Stone Dragon, or White Raven discipline. At 2nd, 8th, and 14th level, you can choose an additional stance. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended, and you do not have to ready them. All the stances you know are available to you at all times, and you can change the stance you currently use as a swift action.

Unlike sorcerers or wizards, who approach arcane magic through the medium of spells, a warlock invokes powerful magic through nothing more than an effort of will. By harnessing his innate magical gift through fearsome determination and force of will, a warlock can perform feats of supernatural stealth, beguile the weak-minded, or scour his foes with blasts of eldritch power.</p>\n<p>Many warlocks are champions of dark and chaotic powers. Long ago, they (or in some cases, their ancestors) forged grim pacts with dangerous extraplanar powers, trading portions of their souls in exchange for supernatural power. While many warlocks have turned away from evil, seeking to undo the wrongs of their former colleagues, they are still chained by the old pacts through which they acquired their powers. The demand to further the designs of their dark patrons, or to resist them, drives most warlocks to seek the opportunities for power, wealth, and great deeds (for good or ill) offered by adventuring.</p>\n<p>Warlocks harbor great reserves of mystical energy. The font of dark magic burning in their souls makes them resistant to many forms of attack and arms them with dangerous power. Warlocks do not wield spells, but they do learn to harness their power to perform a small number of specific attacks and tricks called invocations. Warlocks make up for their lack of versatility by being tougher and more resilient than sorcerers or wizards.</p>\n<p>Warlocks are often chaotic or evil (and more than a few are both). The powers they serve can be cruel, capricious, and wild, unbound by conventional views of right and wrong. However, even warlocks who derive their powers from the most sinister of patrons have been known to turn the black powers at their command against evil. A good-aligned warlock is a grim and fearsome enemy of evil. All too familiar with the darkness lurking in his heart, he gazes unflinchingly on the evil in others and battles the foulest of foes without fear.</p>\n<p>Warlocks know firsthand the power of supernatural beings, so they do not scorn religion. Evil warlocks sometimes seek the favor of cruel and bloodthirsty deities, while good warlocks often turn to the worship of noble and true deities for the strength to win the battle raging in their tortured souls.</p>\n<p>Warlocks are born, not made. Some are the descendants of people who trafficked with demons and devils long ago. Some seek out the dark powers as youths, driven by ambition or the desire for power, but a few blameless individuals are simply marked out by the supernatural forces as conduits and tools. The exact nature of a warlock's origin is up to the player to decide; just as a sorcerer is not beholden to the magic-wielding ancestor that bequeathed his bloodline with arcane power, a warlock is not bound to follow the source that gifted him with magic.</p>\n<p>Warlocks are not half-fiends or tieflings by default (although many creatures of those kinds become some of the most powerful and terrifying representatives of the class). The mark that the supernatural powers leave on their servants is often a mark in the soul, not the flesh. In fact, many warlocks are created by nonevil powers - wild or fey forces that can be every bit as dangerous as demons or devils. Whatever their origin, warlocks are widely feared and misunderstood. Most are wanderers who rarely stay in one place for long.</p>\n<p>Ambitious and often unprincipled, humans are the most likely to seek out the dangerous shortcuts to power that lead to life as warlocks. Half-orcs are common as warlocks as well, since they often find that the powers that create warlocks do not discriminate against individuals of mixed heritage. Warlocks of other races are rare at best.</p>\n<p>The warlock views sorcerers and wizards as bitter rivals. He values the strength and cleverness of resourceful fighters and rogues but rarely gets along with clerics or paladins. Of course, most warlocks understand that it's a bad idea to antagonize their comrades (especially those who hold the key to healing magic), and so they work out an uneasy truce with characters who otherwise might ostracize them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A warlock serves much the same role in an adventuring party as a sorcerer or wizard would. He is much more limited in his abilities compared to the spell selection of spellcasters, and he must rely on his eldritch blast in place of the spell power of an arcane caster. Like a bard, he often fits best in a party that already has another spellcaster or two, since his unique abilities provide him with little magic to use for his companions' benefit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:&nbsp;</strong>Any evil or any chaotic.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die:&nbsp;</strong>d6.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid

This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;to grant half his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A ranger who selects an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;can choose from the following list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Badger\">badger</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Bird\">bird</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-camel\">camel</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Cat-Small\">cat (small)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Rat-Dire\">dire rat</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Dog\">dog</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Horse\">horse</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Pony\">pony</a>, snake (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Viper\">viper</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Constrictor\">constrictor</a>), or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Wolf\">wolf</a>.

At 4th level and higher, his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;is equal to his ranger level – 3.</p>\n<h2>Woodland Stride (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>\n<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>\n<h2>Swift Tracker (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to follow tracks without taking the normal –5 penalty. He takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>\n<h2>Evasion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage.

Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature’s type must correspond to one of his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>Camouflage (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth\">Stealth</a>&nbsp;skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn’t grant&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover\">cover</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment\">concealment</a>.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, a ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>&nbsp;improves. This ability works like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save.

He can now select a quarry as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, and can now take 20 while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>\n<h2>Master Hunter (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, make a single attack against a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;at his full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">attack bonus</a>. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger’s level + the ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;equal to the creature’s current&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"specialActions":[],"activateActions":[],"deactivateActions":[],"perRoundActions":[],"container":"None","containerWeightless":false,"identifiedName":"Ranger"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"kowljhpAAAuoOaJG":3,"55lf1pXToWgc1Dqy":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.D35E.classes.u7dga44lYsIPLYvV"}},"_id":"kV2JI4cu3EyCM9vY"}

Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature’s wrath.

A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting</h2>\n<p>A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;spell of the same level or lower.</p>\n<h2>Chaotic, Evil, Good and Lawful Spells</h2>\n<p>A druid can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Orisons (Sp)</h2>\n<p>Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Druid&nbsp;under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>\n<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>\n<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>\n<h2>Nature Bond (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/air-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Air</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/animal-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Animal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/earth-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/fire-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fire</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/plant-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plant</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/water-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Water</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/weather-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weather</a>. Druids also have access to a set of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/archetypes/paizo-druid-archetypes/animal-and-terrain-domains\">Animal and Terrain Domains</a>. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid’s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Animal-Choices\">Animal Choices</a>. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>\n<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion’s Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>\n<h2>Nature Sense (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(nature) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;checks.</p>\n<h2>Wild Empathy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>. This ability functions just like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.</p>\n<p>The typical domestic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>&nbsp;are usually unfriendly.</p>\n<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>\n<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.</p>\n<h2>Woodland Stride (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>\n<h2>Trackless Step (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>\n<h2>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that target plants, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight\">blight</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/entangle\">entangle</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spike-growth\">spike growth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/warp-wood\">warp wood</a>.</p>\n<h2>Wild Shape (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;type. This ability functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape I</a>&nbsp;spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p>\n<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>\n<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elementals</a>, and plants. Each form expends one daily usage of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or a Small&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>, a druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape II</a>. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body I</a>.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>, a Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape III</a>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body II</a>. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid’s wild shape functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i\">plant shape I</a>.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>&nbsp;or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body III</a>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i\">plant shape II</a>.</p>\n<p>At 12th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>&nbsp;or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body IV</a>. When taking the form of a plant, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i\">plant shape III</a>.</p>\n<h2>Venom Immunity (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>\n<h2>A Thousand Faces (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alter-self\">alter self</a>&nbsp;spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>\n<h2>Timeless Body (Ex)</h2>\n<p>After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.

Your caster level is equal to twice your class level.</p>","spellcastingSpellname":"Spell","spellcastingSpellnamePl":"Spells","hasSpecialSlot":true,"spellPointGroup":"wizard","spellcastingAbility":"int","spellslotAbility":"","spellPointBonusFormula":"0","spellPointTable":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0},"powerPointBonusBaseAbility":"0","powerPointTable":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0},"powersKnown":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0},"powersMaxLevel":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0},"hd":8,"hp":0,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":0,"allSpellsKnown":false,"halfCasterLevel":false,"creatureType":"humanoid","savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"apr":false,"blc":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"coc":true,"crf":true,"dsc":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":false,"fog":false,"gif":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"hid":false,"int":false,"jmp":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"kps":false,"lis":false,"mos":false,"opl":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"src":false,"sen":true,"slt":false,"spl":false,"spt":false,"sur":false,"swm":true,"tmb":false,"umd":true,"uro":false,"aut":false,"psi":false,"upd":false,"spk":false},"nonActiveClassAbilities":[[0,"Ability Boon (Ex)","At 4th level, when choosing an aptitude focus, you also gain a +2 competence bonus to an ability score of your choice.
